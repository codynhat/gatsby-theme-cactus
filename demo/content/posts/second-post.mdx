# Privacy

**You own your data.**

Your health data you choose to export will be saved to a file on your device. Health data is never uploaded to servers. The only time health data leaves your device is when you choose to share the exported file.

No other data is collected by the app or sent to any servers. If you opt-in through Apple, basic diagnostic information and analytics are collected and sent to Apple and the developer. See [Apple Privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/control/) for more information.

# FAQ

## Where is my health data stored throughout the export process?

Your health data is loaded from the HealthKit database and buffered into memory before being saved to a temporary file on your device. This file lives in the "sandbox" of the Health Exporter app. No other apps on your device have access to this file.

Once you choose to share the file or cancel the export, the file is deleted.

## Is my health data encrypted?

The temporary file is encrypted on your device using the iOS default "Protected Until First User Authentication" file protection. See the [iOS Security Guide](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/site/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) for more information.

Once exported, the file is not encrypted.
